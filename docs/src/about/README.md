# About Me

Hello! I'm Yue, the creator of this hobby showcase website. Here's a little bit about me:

I have always been passionate about gardening, photography and coding. Whether it's capturing the beauty of nature through my camera lens, nurturing plants in my garden, or delving into the world of programming and coding, I find joy and fulfillment in pursuing my passions.

This website serves as a platform for me to share my interests, projects, and experiences with others who share similar passions or are simply curious to learn more. Through my photography, gardening tips, coding projects, and more, I hope to inspire and connect with fellow enthusiasts.

Feel free to explore the different sections of the website to learn more about my hobbies and projects. If you have any questions or just want to say hello, don't hesitate to reach out!

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy your time here!
